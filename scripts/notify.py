notify.py — optional push notification for cc-quota-guard's key moments:
a SOFT/HARD quota threshold stopping Claude, cc-run resuming after a sleep,
and the task finishing (or cc-run giving up after retries).

Tested against ntfy.sh (https://ntfy.sh/<topic>, POST body = message text,
`Title` header = a short ASCII tag) — see README's Notifications section
for setup. Any endpoint that accepts a raw-text HTTP POST body works the
same way. This does NOT attempt to speak Slack's or Discord's JSON webhook
shape (`{"text": ...}` / `{"content": ...}`) — that's untested and not
implemented; document the limitation rather than claim compatibility that
was never verified.

FAIL-OPEN, same as the rest of this project: no URL configured, a bad URL,
no network, or a timeout must NEVER raise into the caller or block a hook/
cc-run round. Short timeout so a dead endpoint can't hang anything.

Privacy: this module sends whatever message string it's given — it is the
CALLER's job to only pass already-privacy-safe text. In practice, every
call site in this project reuses text that was already going to be shown
to the human anyway (the hook's systemMessage, cc-run's own status lines)
— never task content or file paths.

URL resolution mirrors hard_abort_enabled's security pattern (see
quota_gate.py's docstring): CC_NOTIFY_URL env var, or the plugin's own
userConfig screen (CLAUDE_PLUGIN_OPTION_NOTIFY_URL, only ever set for hook
invocations — never seen by cc-run itself, same asymmetry as CC_LANG).
Deliberately NEVER read from `.cc-quota/config.json`: unlike the
percentage thresholds, a notification URL is an exfiltration channel — a
cloned/untrusted repo shipping a config.json with its own URL could
otherwise silently siphon your session status (quota %, reset times, when
you're active) to a server you don't control. Only something YOU set
yourself may configure this.

Library usage (quota_gate.py):
    import notify
    notify.notify("some already-safe status line", title="cc-quota-guard")

CLI usage (bin/cc-run, which has no urllib access of its own):
    python3 notify.py <message> [title]
    -> always exits 0; failures are swallowed, never reported as an error,
       so a bad/missing CC_NOTIFY_URL can never break the caller's flow.
