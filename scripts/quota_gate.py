quota_gate.py — Claude Code PostToolUse hook. Registered on a single "*"
matcher (every tool call); it distinguishes planning-tool calls internally
via `tool_name` rather than needing a second matcher registration:

  - On a TodoWrite call — OR, on Claude Code versions that plan this way
    instead, a TaskCreate/TaskUpdate/TaskList call — records the task list
    to `.cc-quota/todos_state.json` (which item is in_progress, and which
    git commit it started from) and checks the SOFT thresholds — session
    and weekly are independent tiers, either can fire on its own (finish
    the current item, then stop cleanly). Supporting both tool families
    matters because they're not interchangeable at the API level: TodoWrite
    sends the whole list, with statuses, in one call every time; TaskCreate/
    TaskUpdate are granular CRUD calls spread over many tool calls, with no
    single call carrying the full picture — see _save_task_tool_state().
    Recognizing only one of these two families means the SOFT thresholds and
    the in_progress bookkeeping (used for hard-abort revert) silently never
    fire on whichever family isn't recognized, no matter how high usage
    gets, since the specific call being watched for simply never happens.
  - On EVERY call: checks the HARD thresholds. A todo item's own work (many
    Edit/Bash/Write calls) can span a long stretch of time after a single
    planning-tool call — if we only checked there, a quota spike in
    between would be caught far too late.

What happens at the hard threshold depends on `hard_abort_enabled`
(default: **false**):
  - disabled (default): Claude is told to stop as safely as possible
    (commit if you can, don't start anything new) — same spirit as the
    soft stop, just triggered mid-item instead of at a boundary. No files
    are touched automatically.
  - enabled (opt-in via CC_HARD_ABORT=1, or the plugin's own userConfig
    screen): if a todo item is in_progress, ALL changes made on that item
    are reverted with `git stash`, the item is marked 'pending' again, and
    it gets redone from scratch after the quota resets.

Why is auto-revert opt-in? This hook is meant to be installed by people
who didn't write it. Automatically running `git stash` on someone's
working tree is a reasonable thing to opt into, not a reasonable default
for a stranger who just ran `/plugin install`. Read the README before
turning it on.

hard_abort_enabled can ONLY be turned on by something the user themselves
controls (an env var they set, or the plugin's configure screen) — never by
`.cc-quota/config.json`, because that file lives inside the project and can
arrive already committed in a repo someone else wrote or you just cloned.
The percentage thresholds ARE safe to read from config.json: they only
change *when* you stop, never *whether* a destructive-ish action happens.

FAIL-OPEN: if usage can't be read (API down, no token, schema changed),
Claude is NEVER blocked. Likewise, if git is unavailable or fails, revert
is skipped but Claude is still told to stop cleanly.

The hard-abort revert assumes the working tree is clean whenever a todo
item starts — i.e. every item ends with a commit. If the previous item
wasn't committed before the next one started, `git stash` will also sweep
up that earlier uncommitted work. This is a known limitation (see
README).

Config precedence for the percentage thresholds (highest wins): CC_* env
vars > .cc-quota/config.json > plugin userConfig > built-in defaults.
hard_abort_enabled uses the same order MINUS .cc-quota/config.json, which
is deliberately never consulted for it (see above). See _load_config().

Trust hardening (why these exist — all closing the same class of problem
as the STOP.json staleness check above: a cloned/untrusted repo can ship
files inside `.cc-quota/` even though that directory is meant to be local,
gitignored runtime state):
  - `.cc-quota` itself is never trusted if it's a symlink or an existing
    non-directory — writing through/over it could otherwise land anywhere
    on disk. See _quota_dir_is_safe().
  - A `todos_state.json` that is actually tracked by git (i.e. committed —
    the opposite of what the README tells users to do) is not trusted to
    claim an in_progress item for hard-abort revert purposes; a planted
    fake in-progress entry must not be able to trigger an automatic
    `git stash` on its own say-so. See _sanitize_state_for_revert().
  - Percentage thresholds from any source are clamped to (0, 100]; an
    out-of-range or unparsable value (e.g. a project shipping
    `session_hard: 99999` to effectively disable the guard, or a typoed
    CC_* env var) is ignored instead of applied or crashing the hook. See
    _parse_pct().

    repo could ship `.cc-quota -> /some/other/path` and have every write
